# Test Project Outline – Module B — Dynamic website with server-side rendering

This document outlines the description of Module B. It is circulated to the competitors and
experts 3 months prior to the competition.
This outline only describes the basic information of module B. The actual test project module will
be created by external Test Project Developers using this outline as a guide.
The module description will be presented on C-2 to all experts. The marking scheme will not be
presented or supplied to competitors or experts during the competition.

## Introduction

Module B will focus on the creation of a dynamic website using a server-side framework.

## Description of project and tasks

In this module, competitors will create a dynamically and server-side rendered website
which the users of the product will use to manage their accounts and additional information.

Parts of the website are protected and only accessible after a successful login.
As this website will be publicly exposed, it must implement the OWASP guidelines.

The client will provide a detailed description of all the required functionalities of this website.
From that, competitors must come up with a database design and implement the website based on it.
Some example data will be provided in the form of CSV files which competitors must use.
However, this CSV data might not be normalized and it is up to the competitors to import it
into their database schema.

Module B has to be implemented using a server-side framework.
It is possible to use additional libraries in the frontend for interactivity, but rendering must be
performed by the server-side framework, and _not_ by a client-side framework calling an API.
Framework and library availability will be limited and will be decided by all experts using
the EuroSkills forums.

## Assessment

Module B will be assessed using the latest stable version of Google Chrome.
Different security aspects will be tested.

## Competition time

Competitors will have **4 hours** to complete module B.
