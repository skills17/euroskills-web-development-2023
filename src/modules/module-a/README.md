# Test Project Outline – Module A – Static Website Design

This document outlines the description of Module A. It is circulated to the competitors and
experts 3 months prior to the competition.
This outline only describes the basic information of module A. The actual test project module will
be created by external Test Project Developers using this outline as a guide.
The module description will be presented on C-2 to all experts. The marking scheme will not be
presented or supplied to competitors or experts during the competition.

## Introduction

Module A will focus on the creation of a static website using HTML and CSS only.

## Description of project and tasks

The competitors will be asked to create a static website for a specified client.
The website will consist of subpages which should be reachable under separate paths.
The design of all subpages should be aligned.

The website has to conform with accessibility standards (WCAG) and implement SEO best practices,
as it will be used to attract new users for a product of the client.

Responsiveness is also important and the website should look good on three different viewports:
mobile, tablet, and desktop.

The client will supply the competitors with a defined website structure and will therein define all
the pages and sections of the website. The client will also provide all content for the website,
such as text, images, and other media, as well as the exact definitions of the
responsive breakpoints.

No server-side or client-side framework will be allowed for module A.
CSS preprocessors may be used, but the generated code must still pass the W3C validations.
Framework and library availability will be limited and will be decided by all experts using
the EuroSkills forums.

## Assessment

Module A will be assessed using the latest stable version of Google Chrome and Firefox.
HTML and CSS will be assessed using W3C validators. Accessibility will be tested using axe.

## Competition time

Competitors will have **3 hours** to complete module A.
