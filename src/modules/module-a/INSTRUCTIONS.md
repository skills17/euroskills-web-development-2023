# Module A â€“ Static Website Design

In this module, you are expected to develop a static website for a client using HTML and CSS only.
The website must consist of four different pages which will be explained in detail in the following sections.

Within the media files, the client provided some media, icons, and text.
You are free to use them or create custom assets on your own.

As the website will be publicly available, it is important to the client that the website conforms to accessibility standards (WCAG) and implements SEO best practices.

The website must be responsive and support at least the following viewports:
- Mobile: 360x640
- Tablet: 768x1024
- Desktop: 1920x1080

No server-side or client-side framework is allowed for module A.
CSS preprocessors may be used.
All HTML and CSS code must pass the W3C validations, even generated one.

## Competitor Information

Module A will be assessed using Google Chrome and Firefox.

The axe browser extension is installed in Google Chrome and allows competitors to validate the website according to the accessibility standards WCAG.

## Website Requirements

The goal of the website is to promote a suite of AI driven APIs.
Potential customers must be able to inform themselves about the possibilities of those APIs, the pricing, and the team behind this product.

You can add more information and elements to all pages as you see fit.
It's also possible to add links that point towards pages that do not exist yet (for example to a login page).

For each page, some example text and more are provided in the media files.
However, not all the provided material has to be used.

The following pages must be implemented.

### Home Page

A short but catching home page.
The idea is to show the product with some simple information and engaging media.
It must contain links to the product and pricing pages where interested visitors can find more information.

### Product Page

The product page shows the whole AI API suite, by listing all available APIs and their features.

### Pricing Page

On the pricing page, the pricing of the APIs must be explained.

### Team Page

As the client is also looking to grow their team, a dedicated team page must show the current employees and also highlight some core values of the company.

### Global Elements

The following elements must be available on all pages:
- **Header**: must at least include a product name in form of text or a logo
- **Navigation**: contains easily accessible links to all pages
- **Footer**: includes at least a copyright notice

All elements can be enriched with more information where it makes sense.
