# Module E â€“ Advanced Web Development

In this module, you are expected to solve three tasks.

Within the media files, you will find three starter kits for each task. You are expected to use these starter kits as a
base for your solution. You are not allowed to use any frameworks or libraries for this module except a
testing framework for task 1.

## Task 1: Writing automated tests

You are given a JavaScript project that has no automated tests. You have to write automated unit tests for the project.
A complete test set is expected which covers 100% of the provided code lines and conditionals. A JavaScript testing
framework must be used.

These are the assessment criteria for this task:

- The tests are grouped logically.
- The tests are written in a way that they are easy to understand.
- The tests pass when running against the original code.
- The tests cover 100% of the provided code lines and conditionals.
- The tests do not pass any logically mutated version of that code (Mutation Testing).
