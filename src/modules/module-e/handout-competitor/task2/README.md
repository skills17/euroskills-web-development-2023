# Handout Module E - Task 2

The News API is deployed for you at the following location:

`https://news-api-{your_module_e_hash}.skill17.com`

A specification of the API is provided to you at:
[`https://api-doc.skill17.com`](https://api-doc.skill17.com)

## Starting the frontend server

Because PWAs do not work with file URLs, a simple HTTP server is provided to you.

Run the following commands **inside this folder** to start the frontend server:
```bash
npm set registry http://registry.skill17.com:5000
npm install
npm start
```

Your web app is then available at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## Provided template

A simple template is already provided to you within the `src` folder.
It provides a starting point and you can extend it to implement the requested functionality.
