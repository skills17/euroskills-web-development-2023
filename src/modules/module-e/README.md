# Test Project Outline – Module E — Advanced Web Development

This document outlines the description of Module E. It is circulated to the competitors and experts 3 months prior to
the competition. This outline only describes the basic information of module E. The actual test project module will be
created by external Test Project Developers using this outline as a guide. The module description will be presented on
C-2 to all experts. The marking scheme will not be presented or supplied to competitors or experts during the
competition.

## Introduction

Module E is not focusing on a single topic, but groups several skills that previously were not covered in the test
project. The skills that will be tested in this module are:

1. Writing automated tests
2. Creating a Progressive Web App (PWA)
3. Creating a Web Component

## Description of project and Tasks

__1. Writing automated tests__

The competitor will be given a JavaScript project that has no automated tests. The competitor will have to write
automated unit tests for the project. A complete test set is expected which covers 100% of the provided code. A
JavaScript testing framework must be used. Library availability will be limited and will be decided by all experts using
the EuroSkills forums.

__2. Creating a Progressive Web App (PWA)__

The competitor will have to create a simple Progressive Web App (PWA), that can work offline, push notifications, and
that is installable on the user's device. The competitor is not allowed to use any frameworks or libraries for this
task. A simple backend along with a documentation will be provided to competitors.

__3. Creating a Web Component__

The competitor will have to create one or more Web Components that can be used in any website. A specification for the
Web Components will be provided. The competitor must also show how the Web Components can be used in a website by
creating a simple website. The competitor is not allowed to use any frameworks or libraries for this task.

## Assessment

__1. Writing automated tests__

It will be assessed if the created test set is grouped logically and if the tests are written in a way that they are
easy to understand. The test must pass when running against the original code, and not pass any logically mutated
version of that code (Mutation Testing).

__2. Creating a Progressive Web App (PWA)__

The functionality of the PWA will be assessed using the latest stable version of Google Chrome. It will be tested that
the app can be installed on the user's device, that it can work offline by showing the last known data, and that it can
receive push notifications.

__3. Creating a Web Component__

The created component API will be checked against the specification. A test page that is not provided to competitors
will integrate the created components and be used to test their functionality.

## Competition time

Competitors will have **3 hours** to complete module E.

## Mark distribution

The table below outlines how marks are broken down and how they align with the WorldSkills Occupation Standards (WSOS).
