# Test Project Outline – Module D — Interactive Frontend using an API

This document outlines the description of Module D. It is circulated to the competitors and experts 3 months prior to
the competition. This outline only describes the basic information of module D. The actual test project module will be
created by external Test Project Developers using this outline as a guide. The module description will be presented on
C-2 to all experts. The marking scheme will not be presented or supplied to competitors or experts during the
competition.

## Introduction

Module D will focus on the implementation of a frontend for a REST API.

## Description of project and Tasks

The competitors will be asked to create a frontend for a REST API. First, users of that frontend will need to log in.
Using the authentication mechanism of the API, the frontend will then be able to access the API and send as well as
retrieve data from it. The functionality created by competitors in this module, builds on top of the functionality
created in module B and C. Competitors will be given a working solution of Module C at the start of Module D, which they
must use. Competitors are not allowed to build on top of their own Module C solution.

The users of the frontend will be able to discover the available functions that the API provides. Each function is then
exposed through a separate page which exhibits several interactive elements, each custom to the function. There will be
complex data inputs and outputs, some of them potentially asynchronous. The goal of the frontend is to hide this
complexity from the user. The frontend must also handle errors and display them to the user in a comprehensible way.

Module D must be implemented using a frontend framework. It is possible to use additional libraries. The application
should be a Single Page Application (SPA). The routing should be handled by the framework. Page reloads should present
the same content to the user as previously visible, except unsaved user driven inputs. Framework and library
availability will be limited and will be decided by all experts using the EuroSkills forums.

## Assessment

Module D will be assessed using the latest stable version of Google Chrome. The assessment will include functional
tests, as well as user experience. Accessibility will be tested using axe.

Any modifications in the provided backend of previous modules, including any changes to the database, will not be taken
into account.

## Competition time

Competitors will have **4 hours** to complete module D.
