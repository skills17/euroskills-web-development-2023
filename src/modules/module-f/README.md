# Test Project Outline – Module F — Fun Module

This document outlines the description of Module F. It is circulated to the competitors and experts 3 months prior to
the competition. This outline only describes the basic information of module F. The actual test project module will be
created by external Test Project Developers using this outline as a guide. The module description will be presented on
C-2 to all experts. The marking scheme will not be presented or supplied to competitors or experts during the
competition.

## Introduction

Module F focuses on having fun with other competitors and being creative.

## Description of project and Tasks

After having created most components for the client, the competitor is now asked to create their own creative function
that can be integrated into the system. More details on what type of functions these should be, will be provided during
the competition. Competitors can be as creative as they want, but the function should be fitting the overall theme.
The functionality itself can be implemented in any way, and it can also be faked. However, the API must be implemented
and working, so the function can actually be integrated into the system.

Competitors are then asked to present their function to the other competitors and the experts. The presentation should
short, include the explanation of what they created and how they came up with that idea. The presentation should be
rounded off with a demo of the function.

## Assessment

The module will be assessed by checking the competitors participation in the module, that there is a function which can
be integrated into the system, and that the presentation is done in a professional manner. Attendance is mandatory for
all competitors to all presentations.

## Competition time

Competitors will have **2 hours** to complete module F.
