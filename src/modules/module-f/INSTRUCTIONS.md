# Module F – Collaborative Challenge

After having created most components for the client, you are now asked to create your own creative AI service
that can be integrated into the system built in previous modules. You can be as creative as you want, but the function
should emulate an AI. The functionality itself can be implemented in any way, and it can also be faked. In fact, given
the limited time, your only option likely is to fake it. Imagine writing a simple switch-case or return random values.
The focus is on the creativity and the presentation of your idea.

However, the service must be implemented and working, so the function could actually be integrated into the system. You
don't have to integrate it into the frontend nor backend you built in previous modules, but you must be able to demo
it in some way or form.

You are then asked to present your service to the other competitors and the experts.

Your presentation must be divided into three parts:

- A _Hook_ to start the presentation and catch the audience’s attention.
- A _Middle Part_ where you explain your work and might also demonstrate something.
- A _Close_ where you round out the presentation.

The middle part must contain a demo. Additionally, you could include any of these elements or others:

- Ambition: Details of the goal you set yourself.
- Approach: Illustrate how you worked to achieve your goal.
- Impact: What impact would your service have on the world?
- Journey: Refer to your journey during this module. Show how you worked, what you learned on the way, where you
  succeeded or failed, or what discoveries you made.

## Assessment

You will be assessed by your presence and participation in the module, that there is a service which can be integrated
into the system, and that the presentation is done in a professional manner. Attendance is mandatory for all
competitors to all presentations.
